    //! Settlement convention of an FX currency pair
    /*! Derives the two settlement dates an FX option needs from its
        trade and expiry dates:

        - the spot date \f$ s_0 \f$ of the trade date \f$ t_0 \f$, on
          which the spot rate is quoted for settlement and the option
          premium is paid;
        - the delivery date \f$ T_d \f$ of an option expiring on
          \f$ T_e \f$, which by market convention is the spot date of
          the expiry date.

        Both are obtained by advancing the given date by the spot lag
        in business days of the calendar.

        The calendar should be the joint calendar of the two
        currencies, and of USD when the pair settles through USD.  The
        spot lag is 2 business days for most pairs and 1 for a few,
        e.g. USD/CAD.

        \warning Some markets apply finer rules, e.g. for USD pairs
                 the first day of the lag only needs to be a business
                 day of the non-USD currency.  These are not modelled;
                 a joint calendar is used for every day of the lag.
