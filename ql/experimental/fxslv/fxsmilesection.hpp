    //! Base class for FX smile sections calibrated to delta-quoted vols
    /*! A section can be built in one of two modes.

        <b>Date mode</b> (constructors taking an expiry date and an
        FxSettlementConvention).  The reference date \f$ t_0 \f$ is the
        trade date: by default the evaluation date, in which case the
        section floats with it; if a reference date is passed, it is
        fixed.  The exercise date is the expiry date \f$ T_e \f$.  Two
        clocks are used:
        - vol time \f$ \tau = \mathrm{yf}(t_0, T_e) \f$, measured with
          the given day counter, which is exerciseTime() and is used for
          the Black standard deviation \f$ \sigma\sqrt{\tau} \f$;
        - the rate period from the spot date \f$ s_0 \f$ to the delivery
          date \f$ T_d \f$, both given by the settlement convention.  The
          discount factors \f$ P(s_0, T_d) = P(t, T_d) / P(t, s_0) \f$
          used in the forward, in the delta conventions and in premium
          adjustment are taken from each curve by date, so they do not
          depend on the curves' reference dates or day counters.
        The forward is \f$ F = S \, P_f(s_0, T_d) / P_d(s_0, T_d) \f$.

        <b>Time mode</b> (constructors taking an expiry time).  An
        idealised setup for model work, tests and interpolation at
        arbitrary times: the time to expiry is fixed (the section does
        not float), there is no settlement lag, and the same time is
        used as vol time and as rate time, i.e.
        \f$ F = S \, P_f(\tau) / P_d(\tau) \f$ on the curves' time
        axis.  For this to be meaningful both curves must share a
        reference date and a day counter; this is checked on
        calculation.  The section's own day counter is not used in this
        mode, since no date has to be converted to a time.

        The market quotes are given as an FxSmileQuotes object: either
        FxRrBfQuotes (ATM, risk reversals and smile or broker strangles
        per delta) or FxDeltaVolQuotes (generic delta-vol quotes).  The
        section fits its smile to the delta-vol quotes that object
        produces and then derives its ATM vol from the fitted smile, so
        that atmVol() always lies on the calibrated curve.
