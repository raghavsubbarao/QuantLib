        the times change, measured in trading time (see
        TradingTimeDayCounter), so that processes and engines built on this
        curve run on the trading-time clock.  Between dates, the discount
        factor at a trading time is the curve's at the corresponding
        calendar time (TradingTimeTermStructure::calendarTime()), which the
        curve's own day counter measures linearly within each day.

        Trading time must always run, for its times to map to calendar
        times one-to-one; this is checked when the curve is built and
        whenever the trading time notifies.  Both must have the same
        reference date.
