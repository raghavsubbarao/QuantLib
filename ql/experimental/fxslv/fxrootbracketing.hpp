    /*! The sign of \f$ f(x_0) \f$ and the slope give the side the root
        is on; the walk goes that way in steps starting at \c step and
        growing by half each time, until the sign changes.  Only points
        between \f$ x_0 \f$ and the root are visited, so the function
        need not be defined beyond the root.  Returns an interval whose
        ends have opposite signs, or \f$ (x_0, x_0) \f$ if \f$ x_0 \f$ is
        a root.  Fails if the function is not finite at a visited point,
        or no sign change is found within \c maxSteps steps.
