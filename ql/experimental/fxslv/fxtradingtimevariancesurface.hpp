        year of trading time, \f$ \sigma_\tau = \sqrt{w / \tau} \f$.
        Between dates the variance is read in trading time, in which the
        surface is interpolated, so that it grows smoothly through an
        event, which takes no calendar time.  Local vol (Dupire) and models
        calibrated on this surface are on the trading-time clock: local
        vol stays smooth over weekends and events.
