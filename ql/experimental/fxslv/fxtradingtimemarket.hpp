    //! An FX market on the trading-time clock
    /*! Local vol, and the variance and leverage of stochastic local vol,
        follow the variance surface: in calendar time they drop over
        weekends and holidays and spike at events, day by day, which
        finite-difference calibrations sample poorly unless their steps
        fall on midnights.  On the trading-time clock of the surface the
        same market is smooth.  This builds the market on that clock:

        - curves with the same discount factor at every date, whose times
          are trading times (TradingTimeYieldTermStructure);
        - the variance surface with the same total variance at every date,
          whose implied vols are per year of trading time
          (FxTradingTimeVarianceSurface);
        - from them, the settlement-forward foreign curve and the Dupire
          local vol, in trading time, and the local-vol process
          (makeFxLocalVolProcess()).

        Instruments keep their calendar dates, and everything that turns
        dates into times does so through these curves, so models
        calibrated and engines pricing on them run in trading time:
        pass them to FxSLVPricingContext, or price with the local-vol
        process.  Prices are those of the calendar-time market for
        vanillas, and a time change leaves continuously monitored
        barriers unchanged; dates are mapped one-to-one.

        Model parameters calibrated on this market are per year of trading
        time, e.g. Heston's kappa, theta and sigma.

        \todo Convert calibrated parameters to calendar-time equivalents
              for reporting, e.g. with the average trading time per
              calendar year over the calibration horizon.

        Trading time must always run, so that it maps one-to-one to
        calendar time: holidays need a positive weight, see
        TradingTimeTermStructure::checkRateIsPositive().
